# MyProject
MyProject is a web application built using the Django framework. It serves as a simple demonstration project for learning Django concepts and practices. The project consists of a single Django app named "greetings."

# Features:

Homepage Display: When users visit the root URL of the application, they are greeted with a "Hello, Django!" message.

# Components:  
Django App (greetings): This app contains a single view function named home, which renders an HTTP response with the message "Hello, Django!" when users access the root URL.

# Development Workflow: 
## Starting the Development Server: 
The Django development server is started using the command python manage.py runserver, allowing the application to be accessed locally in a web browser.

# Viewing the Application: 
Once the development server is running, users can access the application by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in their web browser.
